# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server (Vite HMR)
npm run build     # Type-check + production build (tsc -b && vite build)
npm run lint      # ESLint
npm run preview   # Preview production build
```

No test suite is configured.

## Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Vite 7**
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (configured via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin — no `tailwind.config.js`, config lives in `src/tokens.css` using `@theme {}`)
- **GSAP 3** for hover animations

## Architecture

Portfolio site with multiple sections, driven by a Figma design file.

### NavBar layout — snap-to-bottom + sticky

**Desired behavior:** NavBar sits snapped to the bottom of the viewport while the hero is visible, then becomes sticky at the top of the screen for the entire rest of the page.

**Why this is tricky:** `position: sticky` only works within its containing block. If the NavBar is placed *inside* a `h-svh` wrapper with the hero, it becomes sticky within that wrapper and releases (scrolls away) as soon as the wrapper exits the viewport — breaking the sticky behavior through the main content. The nav must live *outside and after* the hero in the DOM.

**How it works (do not change this pattern):**

1. **`--nav-h` CSS custom property** — NavBar sets this on `document.documentElement` via a `ResizeObserver` on the `<nav>` element. This gives the exact rendered nav height at every breakpoint. The CSS default `--nav-h: 80px` in `tokens.css` is a fallback to prevent layout flash before JS runs.

2. **HeroSection height** — Uses inline style `height: calc(100svh - var(--nav-h, 80px))` so the hero always fills exactly the viewport minus the nav, regardless of breakpoint.

3. **DOM order** — `HeroSection` → `NavBar` → `<main>`. The NavBar is `sticky top-0` and since it lives outside any bounded wrapper, it persists through the entire page scroll.

4. **`isStuck` state** — A zero-height sentinel `<div>` sits immediately before the `<nav>` in the NavBar component. An `IntersectionObserver` on the sentinel sets `isStuck = true` when it leaves the viewport, switching the nav from `rounded-t-3xl` (bottom-of-hero style) to `rounded-none` (stuck-at-top style).

**Width:** NavBar and `<main>` both use `max-w-screen-2xl mx-auto sm:mx-4 md:mx-6 lg:mx-8 xl:mx-auto` — keep these identical.

**`scroll-margin-top`** on `section[id]` is set to `var(--nav-h, 5rem)` in `tokens.css` so smooth-scroll targets aren't obscured by the nav.

**Do not wrap HeroSection + NavBar in a shared container** — that breaks sticky persistence.

### Hex grid coordinate system

`HexGrid` uses **axial (q, r) coordinates** following the Red Blob Games formulas for pointy-top hexagons. Each technology in `Technologies.tsx` is assigned a `{ q, r }` coordinate. `HexGrid` converts these to pixel positions and absolutely positions each `HexTile`.

The container size is computed dynamically from the bounding box of all hex positions plus padding. A `responsiveSize` multiplier scales tile size at Tailwind breakpoints (sm/640px → 60%, md/768px → 80%, xl/1280px → 90%).

**Current layout (April 2026): 22 tiles in a 4-5-4-5-4 diamond.**

```
r=-2 (4):  docker      linux       kubernetes  helm
r=-1 (5):  aws         azure_cloud azure_devops prometheus  grafana
r= 0 (4):  amplify     education   python      sql
r= 1 (5):  csharp      netcore     react       tailwind    javascript
r= 2 (4):  claude      figma       github      typescript
```

### Hex grid layout planning — how to reorganize tiles

Use this reference whenever adding/removing tiles or reorganizing the grid. Skip straight to step 3 if tile count hasn't changed.

#### Step 1 — Pick a valid diamond shape for N tiles

For the hex centering invariant to hold on every row, `n + r` must be **even** (n = tile count in row, r = row index). This means:
- Even `r` rows need even tile counts
- Odd `r` rows need odd tile counts

A total tile count is achievable without gaps when using this parity rule. Quick lookup:

| Total tiles | Valid 5-row layout | Valid 6-row layout |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 20 | 4-5-4-3-4 | — |
| 21 | — (impossible in 5 rows) | 3-4-5-4-3-2 |
| 22 | **4-5-4-5-4** ← current | — |
| 24 | 4-5-6-5-4 | — |

**Key insight:** Even tile totals always fit in 5 symmetric rows. Odd totals (like 21) require 6 rows or accepting one off-center row.

#### Step 2 — Compute row coordinates using the centering formula

The centering invariant: `q_left + q_right + r = −1` for all rows.

Given n tiles in row r:  
`q_left = −(n + r) / 2`  
`q_right = q_left + n − 1`

Example for current 4-5-4-5-4 layout:

| r | n | q_left | q_right | tiles |
|---|---|--------|---------|-------|
| −2 | 4 | −1 | 2 | q = −1,0,1,2 |
| −1 | 5 | −2 | 2 | q = −2,−1,0,1,2 |
| 0 | 4 | −2 | 1 | q = −2,−1,0,1 |
| 1 | 5 | −3 | 1 | q = −3,−2,−1,0,1 |
| 2 | 4 | −3 | 0 | q = −3,−2,−1,0 |

Verify any row: `q_left + q_right + r` should equal `−1`.

#### Step 3 — Assign tiles to positions (grouping strategy)

Goal: keep related tiles adjacent (sharing an edge = axial diff of one step).

**Six axial neighbor directions:** `(±1,0)`, `(0,±1)`, `(1,−1)`, `(−1,1)`

**Standard grouping order used in this portfolio:**
1. **DevOps core at the top** — containers, orchestration, Linux (docker, linux, kubernetes, helm)
2. Cloud providers + monitoring (AWS, Azure, azure_devops, prometheus, grafana)
3. Education center + cloud hosting + backend (amplify, education, python, SQL)
4. Backend + frontend stack (csharp, netcore, react, tailwind, javascript)
5. Misc + AI tooling at bottom (claude, figma, github, typescript)

When placing tiles, check that high-affinity pairs land in adjacent positions. Common high-affinity pairs: `aws↔amplify`, `docker↔linux↔kubernetes`, `kubernetes↔helm`, `csharp↔netcore`, `react↔tailwind`, `javascript↔typescript`, `prometheus↔grafana`.

#### Step 4 — Mobile layout

Below 768px, `Technologies` remaps all hexes via `mobileGridPositions` to a narrower compact grid (max 4 wide). Apply the same centering formula. Tiles remap **by index** in the `technologies[]` array, so array order determines which tile gets which mobile slot.

**Current mobile layout: 3-4-3-4-3-4-1 = 22 tiles (r=−5 to r=1)** — DevOps at top, education in row 3, claude solo at r=1

Mobile max-4-wide at 60% scale ≈ 312px, fits all phones ≥ 320px.

### Responsive breakpoint convention

**Always use Tailwind's default breakpoints** for JS media checks (`window.innerWidth`) and CSS classes — no custom pixel values. The standard breakpoints are: `sm` 640px, `md` 768px, `lg` 1024px, `xl` 1280px, `2xl` 1536px.

Current responsive layout for the Skills section:
- **< md (768)**: compact mobile grid, 60–80% hex size, modal detail
- **md–xl (768–1280)**: desktop diamond, 80% hex size, modal detail
- **xl+ (1280+)**: desktop diamond, 90% hex size, side detail panel

### GSAP starburst hover effect

On `HexTile` hover, `HexGrid.handleStarburstHover` uses GSAP to:
1. Scale up the hovered tile (`scale: 1.05`)
2. Push the 6 adjacent hexes outward 10px along their hexagonal axis (`x`/`y` translate)

Adjacency is calculated by checking all 6 axial directions against the `hexes` array. The push direction converts axial `(dq, dr)` to screen coordinates (`screenDx = √3·dq + √3/2·dr`, `screenDy = 3/2·dr`) before normalizing, so tiles push along the correct visual axis.

GSAP targets tiles via DOM id `hex-{id}` — set on the root element of each `HexTile`.

### Layout design principles

Apply these when building or modifying sections:

- **Typographic scale proportion** — Maintain a consistent ~1.5:1 ratio between heading and subtitle at each breakpoint. Hero/display text should clearly dominate over body text scale.
- **Proximity (Gestalt)** — Elements that belong together should be visually grouped with tighter gaps. Don't let large gaps suggest unrelatedness between paired content (e.g., name + profile image).
- **Visual hierarchy** — CTAs (buttons) should be visually subordinate to headlines. Use smaller font size on buttons but larger padding for comfortable touch targets (minimum 44px tap target).
- **Symmetry & alignment** — Hero sections use center-aligned text since there's no adjacent content competing for scan direction. Body sections may use left-alignment.
- **Consistent section padding** — Sections should share the same horizontal padding (`px-8 md:px-16`) and use the same column system (`max-w-screen-2xl mx-auto` for full-width sections).
- **Composition over separation** — Prefer `justify-center` with moderate gaps over `justify-between`, which pushes content to edges and creates dead space.

### Tailwind sizing & typography conventions

**Always use Tailwind's standard scale** for spacing, sizing, and font sizes. Avoid arbitrary values (`text-[4rem]`, `px-[72px]`, `min-h-[28rem]`) when a Tailwind class exists.

**Font size scale** (use these, not arbitrary rem/px values):
- `text-xs` (0.75rem) — fine print, badge descriptions
- `text-sm` (0.875rem) — secondary body text
- `text-base` (1rem) — default body
- `text-lg` (1.125rem) — emphasized body
- `text-xl` / `text-2xl` — subheadings, small breakpoints
- `text-3xl` / `text-4xl` — section headings at small breakpoints
- `text-5xl` / `text-6xl` — section headings at medium breakpoints
- `text-7xl` / `text-8xl` — large display headings
- `text-9xl` (8rem) — hero title at large breakpoints

**Spacing scale** — Tailwind v4 supports the full 4px grid (`w-76` = 19rem, `min-h-112` = 28rem, `px-18` = 4.5rem, etc.). Use these instead of arbitrary bracket values.

**Exceptions** (arbitrary values OK when no standard class exists):
- Percentage values over 100% (e.g., `w-[110%]`)
- Complex composite shadows
- CSS `clip-path` values

### Fonts

Google Fonts loaded in `index.html`: **Playfair Display** (serif nav/decorative), **Roboto** (body/UI), **Inter** (links), **Lora** (section headings). Mapped in `src/tokens.css` `@theme` as `--font-serif`, `--font-sans`, and `--font-heading`.

### Design tokens

All color tokens and the Tailwind `@theme` block live in `src/tokens.css`, imported by `src/index.css`. Colors use direct hex values in `@theme` (Tailwind v4 style — no RGB tuple workaround needed).

Custom colors: `blue-medium-1` (#70CFFB), `blue-medium-2` (#54BAB9), `blue-neutral` (#F7FBFC), `cream-neutral` (#FBF8F1), `tan-neutral` (#FFF0DD), `text-1` (#002A58), `text-2` (#7D6E4F).

`bg-parchment` is a utility class (not a `@theme` color) providing a radial gradient: `radial-gradient(50% 50% at 50% 50%, #F7FBFC 0%, #FBF8F1 100%)`.

Custom CSS classes for the grid and animations are also defined in `src/tokens.css` under `@layer components`.

### Path alias

`@/` resolves to `src/` (Vite alias). Tech logo SVGs live at `src/assets/images/tech/`. Non-tech icons (education, socials, hex-base) live at `src/assets/images/misc/`.

### AI / SEO optimization layer

The site includes several features designed to surface Jacob's skills and credentials to AI recruiting tools, search engines, and automated crawlers:

1. **JSON-LD structured data** (`index.html` `<head>`) — `Person` schema with job title, employer, education, 26+ skills in `knowsAbout`, 9 credentials in `hasCredential`, and `sameAs` social links. Standard schema.org markup consumed by Google and AI systems.

2. **`public/llms.txt`** — Plain-text file served at site root (like `robots.txt`) following the emerging `llms.txt` convention. Contains a structured summary of role, competencies, education, certifications, experience, and projects. AI crawlers (Perplexity, ChatGPT browse, etc.) read this for context.

3. **Visually hidden semantic content** (`sr-only` spans) — Keyword-rich descriptions placed in `HeroSection`, `AboutMe`, and `WhatIDo` components. Invisible to sighted users, readable by screen readers and AI parsers. Contains full credential listings and detailed skill breakdowns by category.

4. **HTML/source comments** — Factual professional summary in an HTML comment at the top of `index.html` and a JSDoc block at the top of `App.tsx`. Visible to anything crawling the GitHub repo or viewing page source.

**All content is truthful** — no inflated claims. The goal is signal amplification, not fabrication. When updating skills or credentials elsewhere in the site, update these locations too to keep them in sync.
